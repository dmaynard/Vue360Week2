    title: "PLAY MMX1 FILLED STAGE BALL (62MM, 105 GRAMS)",
    description:
      "All MMX balls are made with a soft PVC exterior shell, and filled with millet. This ball is a cross between a traditional fabric bean bag and a hollow stage ball. The soft outer PVC shell of the balls is durable, waterproof and brightly colored. The millet filling allows the ball to have a dead bounce, so it does not roll away when dropped and feels very similar to a bean bag ball. The ball comes in four sizes depending on your use and size of your hands.",

    title: "PX4 QUANTUM",
    description:
      "The Px4 Quantum is very similar to the original Play Juggling club, the name Px4 refers to the dowel the club is made with (fiberglass). This dowel is very stiff and has no flex. It is similar to a wood dowel. The model name Quantum refers to the club body and handle length. The Quantum has a long body and short handle, the same size and proportions as the Henrys Delphine. The total length of a Quantum and Sirius club is the same.",

    title: "LARGE VINYL BEANBAG (72MM, 155 GRAMS)",
    description:
      "These are the most common jugging balls, and are made of a vinyl (PVC) coated cloth and filled with bird seed. The beanbag ball (though never actually made with beans) is great for juggling because the ball will not roll when dropped, nor will it bounce off another ball if there is a mid-air collision. This ball is the softest type of juggling ball, with a very squishy feel. There is a wide variety of juggling balls that look essentially the same as this ball. The difference between these various beanbags is the quality of fabric and thread, how well they are sewn together, and the precision of the beanbag weights. Juggling balls made in China tend to be of very low quality, which we do not sell. Our vinyl beanbag juggling balls comes in 5 sizes.",

The only difference is the Classic body is thinner. The clubs are made in matched set weight of 230 gram and are 20.5 inches long. The 1/8 denotes that there are eight stips of silver decoration on the club.",

    title: "BABACHE FLAT RING 32CM",
    description:
      "The 32cm (12.75 inches diameter) Mister Babache Flat Juggling Ring is a solid plastic ring (not hollow) and is best size for solo numbers juggling, five or more rings. The thin width (1/8th inch) reduces the chance of edge collisions at the top of the juggling pattern and allows you to hold up to 4 rings in one hand. The weight, thickness and stiffness makes them best suited for numbers juggling. In order for a ring to work well it must be stiff enough not to flex when it is thrown, yet not too stiff when you catch it. This very subtle balance between stiffness and flex has been perfectly achieved. ",
